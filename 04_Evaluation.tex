\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{Setup}
Initial tests were done on random data sets generated via the method mentioned in \autoref{sec:datagen}. 

All following tests were executed in docker containers running on a Virtual Machine with an x86\_64 bit architecture, 48 CPUs and 246GB RAM. 

(which data sets have been used? How many data objects? How many clusters? Which programming language and libraries? On which hardware?) [0.5]

\section{Parameters available and their impacts}
Our algorithm depends on many subprocesses which come with several parameters themselves. In this section we discuss their meaning and especially their impact for the clustering results.

\subsection{Metrics: CosineSimiliarity(n1,n2), CosineSimiliarity(n1,n2) + EuclidianDistance(d) [2-3]}

\subsection{Median vs.  Mean [2-3]}

\section{Results between Dense approach with stitching and Global approach (runtime included) [2-3]
}

\section{Test on real world data set(s) [1]}

%evtl. "Hyperparameter sensitivity" d.h. wie 'empfindlich' ist das verfahren bzgl. welchen Parameter Einstellungen?
