In this chapter 
Clustering in Arbitrary Subspaces based on the Hough transform (CASH) is cool, however its complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.
We try to do it better via using a density based approach to prune away irrelevant points and noise..

% Maybe OPTICS? DIRECTLY COPIED OUT OF \cite{ankerst1999optics}
%  First, almost all clustering algorithms require values for input parameters which are hard to
% determine, especially for real-world data sets containing highdimensional objects. Second, the algorithms are very sensible to
% these parameter values, often producing very different partitionings of the data set even for slightly different parameter settings.
% Third, high-dimensional real-data sets often have a very skewed
% distribution that cannot be revealed by a clustering algorithm using only one global parameter setting.
